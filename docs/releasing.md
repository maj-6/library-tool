# Releasing

The Downloads page on the website renders the `releases` table in Supabase,
newest row per platform. Publishing a release means getting a row into that
table with a URL people can download; the static site itself never changes or
redeploys for a release.

## Versioning

The project is pre-1.0: it versions on a `0.x` line while it is still taking
shape (`0.x` signals that anything may still change). The two apps version
independently — the desktop from `desktop/package.json`, Book Capture from its
gradle `versionName` — and the `v*` tag names the GitHub Release after the
desktop version. Bump the patch for fixes and the minor (`0.4` → `0.5`) for
features; save `1.0.0` for the first release meant to be stable. Do not renumber
back into `3.x` — those tags are kept only as archived history from before the
reset. One consequence of the reset: a desktop release numbered below an
installed `3.x` build will not auto-update it (electron-updater only moves
forward), so those few installs need a one-time manual reinstall. Android is
unaffected — it updates by `versionCode`, which keeps climbing regardless of the
`versionName`.

## Release standards

The project is pre-1.0 and ships **intermediate builds on purpose**. Alpha/beta
builds are expected to be produced and published for download and testing —
known TODOs, loose threads, and half-finished features (see **Known caveats**
below, and whatever is open at the time) are acceptable in them. That bar does
**not** carry to a stable release: `1.0.0`, and any later build promoted as
stable, must clear a higher one — no non-functioning or visibly incomplete
features, and the known caveats burned down. Treat everything before then as a
testing line, and keep intermediate builds flowing so there is always something
to try.

Cut an intermediate build as a semver **prerelease** so it stays testable
without reaching stable users:

- Version it with a prerelease suffix — `desktop/package.json` `0.7.0-alpha.1`
  (then `-alpha.2`, `-beta.1`, `-rc.1`, finally plain `0.7.0` for the stable
  cut). Bump the Android `versionCode` too if the APK rides along.
- Tag it `v0.7.0-alpha.1` and push. The existing `v*` pipeline builds it, and
  because the tag carries `-alpha` / `-beta` / `-rc` it:
  - flags the GitHub Release **prerelease**, so the desktop auto-updater
    (`allowPrerelease` stays false — desktop/main.js) never offers it to stable
    users; they hold at the last stable version.
  - registers the `releases` row on the **`alpha` / `beta` / `rc` channel**, so
    it appears in the Downloads page's **Other downloads** section instead of
    replacing the stable card.

A plain `vX.Y.Z` tag (no suffix) is the stable path — GitHub "Latest", the
stable auto-update channel, and the main Downloads list. Reserve it for builds
that actually meet the bar above.

Two ways a row gets there:

## The pipeline (the normal way)

`.github/workflows/release.yml` runs on the public repo when a `v*` tag is
pushed:

1. **android** builds `android/BookCapture` (`assembleRelease`, signed with the
   keystore secret if present, the runner's debug key if not) and names the APK
   after its gradle `versionName`.
2. **desktop** freezes the Flask sidecar with PyInstaller and runs
   electron-builder on a Windows runner, producing the NSIS installer
   `LibraryTool-Setup-<package.json version>.exe` **plus `latest.yml` and the
   `.blockmap`** — those two are the auto-update channel: installed apps check
   the newest GitHub Release at startup and read them to fetch the update.
3. **publish** attaches everything to a GitHub Release named after the tag,
   then registers the APK and the installer in the `releases` table via
   `tools/release_publish.py` (URL → the GitHub Release asset). The Downloads
   page shows them immediately, and existing installs pick the update up on
   their next launch.

So cutting a release is:

```
# bump versions first if warranted:
#   android/BookCapture/app/build.gradle.kts   versionCode + versionName
#   desktop/package.json                       version
git tag v0.4.0
git push <public> master:main --follow-tags    # or push the tag with the next mirror publish
```

A `workflow_dispatch` run of the same workflow is a dry run: both apps build
and the artifacts are inspectable, nothing is published.

### One-time repository setup (public repo, Settings → Secrets and variables)

| name | kind | purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | variable | already set for the pages workflow |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | secret | writes to `releases` (anon is read-only by RLS). Without it the GitHub Release still happens; the register step warns and skips. |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_B64` | secret | base64 of the signing keystore. Local copy: `~/.whl-release/bookcapture.jks(.b64)`, password in `bookcapture-keystore-info.txt` next to it. |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | secret | its password |
| `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` | secret | `bookcapture` |

Keep one keystore forever: Android refuses to update an installed app whose
signing key changed — users would have to uninstall first (settings and the
capture queue survive an update, not an uninstall).

## By hand (no CI)

`tools/release_publish.py` does the registration half on its own, with the
desktop's Supabase credentials (Settings → Sync) or `SUPABASE_URL` /
`SUPABASE_KEY` in the environment:

```
# upload a local file to the public `releases` bucket and register it
python tools/release_publish.py BookCapture-0.2.0.apk --platform android --version 0.2.0

# register a file hosted elsewhere (sha256/bytes computed if the file is local)
python tools/release_publish.py LibraryTool-Setup-0.4.0.exe \
    --url https://github.com/…/LibraryTool-Setup-0.4.0.exe --platform windows --version 0.4.0
```

The bucket route is for small files — Supabase's free tier caps one object
around 50 MB, which the APK fits and the installer does not. Re-publishing the
same platform/version/channel replaces the row, so corrections are safe.

## Known caveats

- The installer is unsigned (no code-signing cert), so SmartScreen will warn
  on first run.
- The 40 MB `copyright_renewals.csv` is deliberately absent from the public
  mirror; the sidecar spec skips missing data files, so the CI build simply
  ships without that dataset — the in-app setup guide offers it (and the other
  large databases) as a download on first run.
- A version only auto-updates existing installs if `latest.yml` made it onto
  the newest GitHub Release — the artifact step fails loudly if it is missing,
  but don't delete it from a release by hand.
